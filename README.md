# ConfMe Workshop
This workshop gives you a first glance how you can use ConfMe for data science projects. It is intended for people who have no prior knowledge of ConfMe, but are otherwise familiar with Python and Data Science. Each sub-folder explains one scenario with a separate readme. The scenarios we cover are:

| Scenario              | Description                                                                                                           |
|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00_basic_example      | First steps with ConfMe (really basic examples drawn from the official [README](https://github.com/iwanbolzern/ConfMe) |
| 01_sagemaker_training | Training a PyTorch model on SageMaker including hyperparameter optimization (coming soon)                             |
| 02_fastapi_deployment | Deploying the trained SageMaker model with FastAPI as REST Endpoint (coming soon)                                     |
