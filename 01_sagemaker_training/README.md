Therefore, we will first have a look how we can use ConfMe for training a Machine Learning Model on Sagemaker and afterwards deploy it as part of a FastAPI microservice. Please note that the model we are training you could easily train on your own machine and we only use Sagemaker for demonstration purposes.

## Our Challenge
We should not use a very difficult problem, so that we can focus on the advantages of ConfME ðŸ˜‰. Our challenge is to classify handwritten digits. I see you guessed it, I am talking about solving the well-known MNIST data set. Spoiler alert: it is already solved at least one thousand times ðŸ˜Š.
